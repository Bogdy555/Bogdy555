## About me

I am a student at computer science (University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics).
My development journy started when I was 14 out of curiosity, therefor I am a self thought developper.
I consider myself ambitious, curios, energetic and pasionat.

## Favourite things about computer science

* Software Design

Good code has structure. No structure, no scaleability. No scaleability, it's going to crash right on top of you.

* 3D Rendering

It is just fascinating. When you do it from scratch and every piece falls into place, it is just an unreplaceable feeling. Not to mention the amazing visuals.

* Operating Systems

I will never stop asking "why?" when it comes to computers. This subject fits me like a glove since it answered many of my questions.

* Embedded Systems

The reasoning is the same as before, but the meaning is deeper. Buckle up, next stop that this buss takes is the one and only CPU.
